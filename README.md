# Github App

First Android app I made as part of RUMAD's Accelerator program, with some of my own additions.

This is an Android app showing a Github user's basic information, 
such as their bio, the number of public repositories they have, and their followers/following count.

Made with Android Studio using Github's API, Retrofit, GSON Converter
